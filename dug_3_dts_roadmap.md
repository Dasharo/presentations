# Dasharo Tools Suite a.k.a. DTS

.center.image-99[![](/img/dts-logo.jpg)]

* Set of tools and scripts running in minimal Linux environment
  - https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/overview
* DRY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyctrnJNTPc&t=5162s
* Since last DUG we had quite a lot of silent releases and one public:
  - by silent we mean not announced in Dasharo Universe documentation,
  - v1.2.6 - beta/preview release, not recommended for wider use,
  - v1.2.8 - fully featured, validated release into which we will dive on
    next slides,

# üêõ Bugs everywhere üêõ

* We are aware of feature requests and bugs related to DTS.
  - It works for most use cases, but still need improvements.
* We have to improve hardware checks before flashing.
  - There are reports of people flashing MSI Z690-A v1.1.1 on platforms with
    Intel Raptor Lake, which is not supported by that release and DTS should
    detect and prevent sych lockout.
* As of 26/09/2023 there are 31 bugs, enhancements and other reports open in
  dasharo-issues repository, and 17 clossed.
* If you feel you found some problem please report it:
  - https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues
