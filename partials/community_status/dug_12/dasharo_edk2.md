SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN in Q4 2025 - we merged only 4 PRs this quarter!

* This is our LOWEST quarterly merge count in the tracked history
* Average merging tempo: ~14.5 PRs/quarter (calculated from 10 quarters)
* Q4 2025 performance: 4 PRs merged (72% below average)
* Open PR backlog grew from 22 to 25 (+3 PRs)
* Closed (not merged) PRs remained at 50

This quarter's extremely low merge rate (4 PRs) represents a major deviation
from our typical performance. Recent quarterly trends showed strong activity:
- Q2 2025: 23 PRs merged
- Q3 2025: 14 PRs merged
- Q4 2025: 4 PRs merged ← ALERT: Significant drop

We created 7 new PRs this quarter (7 total increase = 4 merged + 3 open).

Historical merging performance (last 10 quarters):
- Q1 2023: 8 PRs
- Q2 2023: 8 PRs
- Q3 2023: 22 PRs
- Q4 2023: 19 PRs
- Q1 2024: 8 PRs
- Q2 2024: 18 PRs
- Q3 2024: 20 PRs
- Q4 2024: 10 PRs
- Q1 2025: 13 PRs
- Q2 2025: 23 PRs
- Q3 2025: 14 PRs
- Q4 2025: 4 PRs ← Current quarter

Average: (8+8+22+19+8+18+20+10+13+23+14+4) / 12 = 167/12 = ~13.9 PRs/quarter

This slowdown warrants investigation - possible causes could include resource
allocation, reviewer availability, or shifting priorities to other repositories.
