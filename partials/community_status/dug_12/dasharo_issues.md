* We definitely feel slow down in bug fixing and essentially issues reporting.
There are multiple reasons for that. We were very much focused on new releases,
out which some still didn't saw light of day. Some releases were not accounted
and so some extent dasharo-issues does not reflect all accomplishments yet.

Modify and run:
./diagrams/dasharo_issues.py --dug-num 12
