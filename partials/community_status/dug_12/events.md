[click] 7th Qubes OS Summit was great event we were very proud host notable
guests, have great conversation and spent time together.

[click] Then we had ZDM#3 during which continue our theme of provisioning and
maintaining user controlled Root of Trust and Chain of Trust, there were other
interesting talks like Android security, Context Based Authentication and
others.

[click] Right now in Tokyo is Maciej Pijanowski who represent 3mdeb and help
coordinate our long standing System Boot and Security Microconference. He will
have talk on Saturday, 10:25 Tokyo time (6:25 PM CET) about fwupd/LVFS HSI.
That will conclude 3mdeb 2025 year. Thanks to Maciej visiting Tokyo I could
stick to original timeline of DUG/vPub. Otherwise we would have quite tight
timeline, before Christmas.

[click] HWIO NL was cancelled because of lack of interest in UEFI Secure Boot
and Intel Boot Guard training. It was great experience and maybe we can repeat
it at some point in future.

# 2025 summary

* We attended as organizers, co-organizers or guests 11 events.
* This is two more than in 2024, but 6 less than in most active year 2021.
* 2026 we plan rather calm. We minimize our activity on public events, but
focus more on managing and promoting our own.

[click] Unfortunately because of changes in strategy how FOSDEM is organized
our open-source firmware devroom was not accepted. Luckily one of our talks was
accepted in Confidential Computing devroom and we will talk there about our
most recent achievements in server space and role of OpenSIL in building
trustworthy ecosystem.

[click] In March we will have another DUG, number 13, but that one would be
last before 9 months break. Next one will be in December.

[click] Similarly with ZDM, number 4, we switching our gears and we will have
two events per year. There would be one in may and another one in November.

[click] For Q4 2026 we plan spinning off 3mdeb organized event focused on Boot
Security in content of building high assurance infrastructure.

[click] We will also hold ZDM#5 and DUG#14 right after, as a virtual
counterpart, in November and December, although there is quite a lot of time
and we will see if that plan will hold.

Our focus is the boot chain: from owner‑controlled roots and chains of trust
and decentralized reproducible builds with bootstrappable toolchains, through
key boot-chain components for x86, ARM, POWER, and RISC‑V, ending with the
handoff to OS-maintained bootloaders or the OS itself. We believe boot-chain
components are foundational blocks of sovereign digital infrastructure.

This cannot be established without a diverse spectrum of contributors, and
that's why we welcome sponsors, speakers, and attendees at all levels of
contribution from the community, SMEs, OEMs/ODMs, IBVs, researchers,
hyperscalers, and the public sector. We want to build a community that will
consider multi‑stakeholder perspectives on boot‑chain security.

# Boot Security Mastery Conference 2025

From the homelab of a privacy-focused admin to the high assurance of
hyperscaler core infrastructure, we want to discuss the foundation of
trustworthy, owner‑controlled, confidential, and verifiable computing.

Before the main conference, we will host dedicated pre‑conference training days
focused purely on education for practitioners. These hands‑on trainings are
aimed at developers, platform and firmware engineers, and security engineers
who implement security measures in the boot chain, provision and manage roots
of trust, evaluate and harden boot flows, and manage chains of trust at the
boot‑chain level. Participants will work with real tooling and platforms to
learn how to design, deploy, and verify secure, owner‑controlled boot‑chain
architectures in practice.

Unlike OSFC, which focuses broadly on open-source firmware projects and
ecosystems, this conference is specifically about boot-chain security, trust,
and sovereignty: owner-controlled roots and chains of trust, verifiable build
and boot pipelines, and their role in sovereign digital infrastructure. It also
includes dedicated pre-conference training days for developers and engineers
who implement, provision, and operate boot-chain security in practice

We still didn't delivered, that's on me. I have huge stack of not contributed
content. Next checkpoint is after QOSS and hopefully I can deliver something in
Q4.
