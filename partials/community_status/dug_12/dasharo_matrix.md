User base growth analysis:

We've reached 500 users milestone in Q4 2025! Growth rate remains healthy:
- Q3 2025: 478 users → Q4 2025: 500 users (+22 users, +4.6% growth)
- Previous quarter: 458 → 478 (+20 users, +4.4% growth)

The growth rate has stabilized at around 20-22 users per quarter, which is a
positive sign of sustainable community expansion. While we're not seeing
explosive growth, the steady trajectory indicates:

* Consistent word-of-mouth and organic discovery
* Retained user engagement (low churn rate)
* Strong foundation for future growth

We expect growth to accelerate with upcoming platform releases and increased
marketing efforts. The 500-user milestone is a significant achievement and
provides a solid base for scaling community initiatives.
