<!--
We would also like to introduce you to some changes on our blog:
* Some time ago we've dropped the Disqus comments plugin, because of the ads.
* Recently, we've introduced open source project named Comentario, that seems to
  satisfy our needs
* The historical comments were successfully migrated, so you can now share your
  thoughts about recent and past articles
* Simple account creation is needed, but we will also enable login via popular
  external providers like GitHub, LinkedIn or Twitter/X

<!--
* Additionally, Statistics page caught our attention:
  - at first, only Last 30 Days were visible - see the screenshot
  - after the contact with Comentario maintainer, dynamic range was introduced
    in recently released version v3.14.0, resolving our request
  - we are testing this feature and consider partially replacing the Google
    Analytics for this open-source alternative
* <describe statistics from ~20 days>

We are looking forward to the fruitful technical discussions on the blog and
more!
