<!--

Sovereign Boot Provisioning Wizard is an UEFI application designed to guide end
users through the provisioning of UEFI Secure Boot. The objective is to offer a
user-controllable mechanism for managing platform trust relationships and
establishing UEFI Secure Boot infrastructure, with a primary focus on
transparency, informed consent, and usability.

Unlike traditional firmware interfaces, which expose UEFI Secure Boot as a
collection of loosely connected toggleable settings and unmanaged certificate
stores, this application presents a coherent, wizard-like experience. Its
purpose is to make the process of reviewing and enrolling platform keys
intuitive for users who are not security experts.
