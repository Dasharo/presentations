* As I told you Q2'25 was just silence before storm. We essentially trippled
number of open bugs and more than double closed one. Of course part of that is
cleanup of dasharo-issues, but cleanup is part of keeping project healthy. But
quite a lot is related to new development about which I will tell you more in
roadmap section.

Modify and run:
./diagrams/dasharo_issues.py
