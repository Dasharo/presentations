[click] For those interested in all-things Embedded including Linux, OpenWRT and OpenBMC, we had Zarhus Developers Meetup in August. I will talk little bit more about it on next slides.

[click] DUG#11 and vPub 0x10 happen as always. It is already 11th DUG and 15th
vPub. Time passing by.

[click] Qubes OS Summit happen in a week. It would be completely different event, then last 6 one, but more details on further slides.

[click] in Q4, we do not plan much, but still ZDM #3, HWIO NL with updated
version of UEFI Secure Boot and Intel Boot Guard training.

[click] And we will finish year with classical LPC this time in Tokyo. CfP is
still open if you would like to present your booting and security topic to
Linux Maintainers.

[click] Because of LPC we have to shift DUG in a week. I hope it
will not complicate things more.

Some maybe noticed that we improved 3mdeb Events website and migrated to
hi.events from attendize.

We also migrated to selfhosted Listmonk instance from unmaintained Mailtrain.
We hope this will improve subscribers experience.

Next week great event coming Qubes OS Summit 2025. It would be 7th edition of
the event and we are glad to have so many sponsors and almost all seats at
location taken as well all virtual seats taken.

No, worries event will be streamed to youtube. There are some talks which will

* After lunch Alyssa will will discuss comparmentalization and highlight
differences between Qubes OS and Spectrum, which is very interesting project of
new OS with similar concepts as Qubes OS, but with the goal of being much more
lightweight.
* Then I will try to build upon Miczyg hardware/firmware talk vision of Qubes
Air as vertically integrated security and privacy solution for Technical
Professionals. Kind of my dream for thin client and server model.
* Ali will discuss various usage related topics including Qube labaling, icons, desktop effects and similar quality of life improvements.
* Then as always Marta will expand topics related with GUI Tooling in Qubes and
will call for contributors giving proofs it is not that scary as it seems.

<!--

If you would like to meet us and see talks live please note there are just 6
tickets left. Room will be fully packed since we sold or allocated for sponsors
remaining 64 seats from 70 people room capacity.

If 200EUR is expensive to you and you can prove your contribution to Qubes or
surrounding ecosystem feel free to reach out to us. Maybe we can do something
with that. For others? I'm sorry, two months earlier tickets were for 50EUR.
