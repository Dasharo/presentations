- SMI Transfer Monitor
- UEFI Capsule Update integration
- New Measured Boot
- Qubes OS Certification
- NVMe disks through adapter

will us it on hardwear.io public in-person training and for future OST2 classes

We also provide PC Engines refurbished units. This hardware is no longer
officially available.

Setup comes with:
- TPM2.0
- 3 years of Dasharo Pro Package

It is unique old piece of hardware, but still serves as very stable router. If
your goals are more on stability, firmware updates, low TDP this may be option
for you.

Number of units is very limited.
