Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) v0.1.1 is available.

This is old Ivy Bridge hardware, but still capable and cheap.
What is important there are multiple interesting functions available like:
- ME Neutering - means essesntially cutting off "unneeded" pieces of ME
- Possible TrenchBoot aka AEM for Qubes OS.
- Possible SMI Transfer Monitor.
- UEFI Capsule Update integration
- New Dasharo Measured Boot which cover correctly coreboot and EDKII/UEFI payload.
- NVMe disks support through adapter.
- Qubes OS Certification - Unfortunately not possible due to end of life on Intel side, Intel do not provide microcode fixes, biggest value for that hardware is potential of TrenchBoot.

No longer under pre-order. Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) v0.9.0 was released.

Current release is minimalistic but we already planning new version which will be closer in functionality to closed source firmware.

The goal of this platform is to serve as base line for hardware training which
we provide as part of various conferences, as well as directly to customers. It
will be also very useful for students who want to get through upcoming OST2
UEFI Secure Boot course.

We also provide PC Engines refurbished units. This hardware is no longer
officially available and we can consider it last of its kind.

Setup comes with:
- TPM2.0
- 3 years of Dasharo Pro Package

It is unique old piece of hardware, but still serves as very stable router. If
your goals are more on stability, firmware updates, low TDP this may be option
for you.

We offer apu2e and apu6a and b.

Number of units is very limited.

<!--

[click]
Itâ€™s essential to explicitly mention that we provide both **On-Site
Instructor-Led for Individuals** and **Remote Instructor-Led Group** options.
These are significant formats that provide structured guidance and should be
highlighted for clarity.

[click]
Within segments we don't want to create **Business** categories, although from
our experience it is closely related to annual training budget of organization.
Obviously bigger organization typically have bigger budget.

[click]
We can always discuss custom training but those solutions are typically with
higher price tag. Over 10 years of activity in platform security we gathered
information and hand-on experience from many areas of low level security,
because of that we can tackle almost any topic. If in doubt contact us.

[click]
"Extended Direct Support from Instructor" means Instructor is not only
available during training event, but also would respond to questions before and
after training. Of course unless it turns into consulting endeavour, but please
note we are not a lawyers we don't count for every hour.

[click]
Potential discounts for bulk training purchases or long-term contracts, which would be appealing to corporate clients are possible

[click]
Regarding additional features there can be availability of recordings for
Remote sessions or The PET Blueprint and Pace Training Reference Guide
containing extensive editorial version of speaker notes.
