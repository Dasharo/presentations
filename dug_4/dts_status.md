# DTS silent releases

* **v1.2.9 - 2023-09-29**
    * Added [Firmware Update
    Mode](https://docs.dasharo.com/guides/firmware-update/#firmware-update-mode)
    integration, which speed up the process of Dasharo firmware update.
    * Added efivars support and efivar utility to support FUM.
    * Improved logging of DTS menu options to not throw redundant and confusing
    logs e.g. from flashrom.
    * Fixed problem with EC firmware using incorrect link.
* **v1.2.10 - 2023-10-17**
    * Added [Dasharo Configuration Utility](https://github.com/Dasharo/dcu) which
    allow to change logo displayed on boot and many more. More about that in
    dedicated presentation.
    * Added SMMSTORE migration for NovaCustom laptops, so the Dasharo Setup settings
    are preserved after firmware update.
    * Added CI/CD pipeline to generate signatures.
