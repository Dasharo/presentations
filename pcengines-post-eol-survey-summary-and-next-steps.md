# What is it about?

* In September 2022 PC Engines decided to discontinue sponsorship for
  open-source firmware on their devices.
* We announced that recently after v4.19.0.1 release (Feb 2023).
* We sent survey to community to ask, if there is interest in continuation of
  open-source firmware support through potential subscription model.
* In following presentation we want to share summary and next steps regarding
  PC Engines open-source firmware support future.

# Summary

* We would like to thank all of the respondents for taking the time and
  providing valuable feedback.
* Some questions in survey could be explained better, maybe with example.
* We received 100+ answers, 
* Over 50% of respondents are interested in paid model
  - yearly subscription is most popular among other requests

???

- `How many PC Engines apuX platforms would you like to support with regular firmware updates?`
- was interpreted as question about which PC Engines platforms apu1,apu2 and so
  on, should get updates
- what we intended to ask was how for how many hardware devices/units, given
  respondent would like to get updates

# Next steps

* Survey about preferred payment methods
* Other options:
  - donation driven development +3
  - on-demand custom firmware builds
  - charging for each release +1
  - one-off upgrades
  - paid Technical Assistant Center (TAC) support
  - provide roadmap you planning to implement +1

---

# Decision

* Because of feedback we received we opt for donation-only model for now.
  - subscription model with expressed interest is not economically feasible
* What may change situation?
  - more business customers interested in supporting open-source firmware
    updates
  - crictial mass of users who want to see subscription model
