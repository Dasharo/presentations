# Event page plans

- migration to `events.dasharo.com`
  - `vpub.dasharo.com` seem to be to much focused on virtual events
- grand unification under MkDocs
  - `docs.dasharo.com + dasharo.com + events.dasharo.com ?`
- Git Cliff support
- Ideas and bug reports welcome:
  - https://github.com/dasharo/presentations/issues
