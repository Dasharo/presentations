Input for Dasharo Community Support Roadmap

I believe that the DTS should only appear in DCS Roadmap table if something is
provided in the system that relates to a particular Dasharo firmware release. At
this point, I can suggest three items that are reasonably universal and that
will be able to be entered into the various cells in this table.

* Enabling Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment
  - adding the functionality for given platform/release
    https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#dasharo-zero-touch-initial-deployment
  - it seems to me that we should do this every time we enabled a new platform
    or when we release a new Community Release (available to everyone)

* Providing safe Dasharo firmware update
  - obvious thing that DTS will have the possibility to upgrade if a new release
    is available, but perhaps it is worth mentioning
  - add https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#firmware-update
    for given release

* Dasharo Tools Suite test cases
  - peforf test described in
    https://docs.dasharo.com/unified-test-documentation/dasharo-compatibility/326-dasharo-tools-suite/
  - from that given release all later releases will also have tests results
    attached

Below, where given point should go in the DCS Roadmap table

things that goes into GH milestone
