# History

.center.image-99[![](/img/osfv.png)]

* We use OSFV at least since 2018, when we started validate PC Engines releases
* Using those scripts we over **50k** tests publicly relasing **150+** binaries
  based on open-source firmware.
* Initially it was closed source because of assumption that validation provide
  majority of the value in open-source firmware development.

* Dasharo Open Sourve Firmware Validation consist of scripts written in Robot
  Frameworks,
* MIT licensed,
* Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework. It can be used
  for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).
  - Used by OpenBMC and various organizations.
* To maximize use of Dasharo OSFV you need dedicated infrastructure.
