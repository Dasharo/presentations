# Next Gen Dasharo Workstation/Server

3mdeb announces a Call for Partners to collaborate on developing open-source
firmware for a next-generation workstation/server hardware platform. This
initiative aims to leverage long-term available hardware, specifically designed
for industrial applications, with a production guarantee of 7-10 years. Unlike
consumer market mainboards with a short lifespan of 2-3 years, these platforms
ensure a sustainable and profitable investment by extending the potential
revenue period significantly.

- **Long-Term Hardware Availability:** Focus on hardware that supports a 7-10
  year production guarantee, offering a stable foundation for open-source
  firmware development.
- **Sustainable Investment:** Leverage long-term hardware availability to
  ensure that the initial development investment is recoverable and profitable
  over time.
- **Community and Industry Collaboration:** Aim to build a critical mass by
  collaborating with various parties interested in supporting open-source
  firmware initiatives.

### Call for Additional Partners
